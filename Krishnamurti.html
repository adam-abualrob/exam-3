                <h1>What Is the Difference Between the Human Brain and the Computer?</h1>
                <p>The computer can do what a human being does: acquire experience, store up memory, respond, learn, and add more knowledge. It can play chess with an expert, a master. The first time, it is beaten, but it learns the moves and why it has been beaten. That learning is stored up as memory. The second time it plays, it learns more; the third or fourth time, it beats every chess master. That is how our brains work – learning, knowledge, fail, more knowledge, and gradually we become expert.

                    Now, what is the difference between the human brain and the computer? I am not an expert, but I have talked to experts in California, Europe and India. If you have studied it a little bit, you will see this is what the computer is doing: learning constantly, acquiring knowledge so that it can respond instantly. And that is what our brain is doing. So what is the difference between the human brain and the computer? There isn’t any. I wonder if you see this. If a machine can do it, and the human brain can do it too, there is not much difference. But the human brain has some other quality: to find out what intelligence is. If the computer can do what the human brain can do, then we are not intelligent. There must be a quality of intelligence which only we can find out.
                <h1>The Problem Facing Humanity</h1>
                <p>Computers can do everything thought can do. The computer can learn, correct itself, and from that correction learn further. The computer can do what thought can do – it can say, ‘I believe in God,’ because it has been programmed that way, as we human beings have been programmed, as we human beings have been wired to say, ‘I am a Hindu,’ or Buddhist, or ‘I believe in God.’ The computer, being programmed like us, can say exactly what you are saying. I wonder if you realise the consequences of this.

                    Modern technology has taken over your brain. It is happening; this is not the invention of the speaker. Computer experts are very clear that all thought can do, the computer can do. And with the robot, the computer can do mechanical work in a factory, producing cars without the help of man. So what becomes of man? What becomes of you when what you think, what you feel, what you have – all that thought – the machine can do? Do you understand the seriousness of this? We have to meet a tremendous crisis. This is a problem facing mankind: the machine, invented by thought takes over all the activity of thought and leaves man with what? What has he then?
                    </p>
                    <h1>The computer is doing everything that thought can do.</h1>
                <p>It can be told how to meditate, and will tell you how to meditate – it becomes your guru! Please don’t laugh, this is much too serious. I don’t think you realise what is happening. It will give you a new mantra. It will take over all the activity of thought, and where is man then? If the computer and robot take the place of man, what is man then? Either he pursues pleasure, entertainment, football, television, sex, or all the circus that goes on in the name of religion, which is another form of entertainment, or he turns inward. You have that choice in front of you. It is coming; this is your challenge. If you pursue entertainment, invented by thought through computers, your life then becomes totally empty. Or you turn to the psychological, inward search.

                    So this is facing you as a human being. If you are concerned and therefore accept this challenge, you either turn inward or pursue pleasure and entertainment. You have lived on thought. Your activity is based on thought. Your thought has denied love. Your thought has made the computer. And you, as a human being, have been deprived of all the things thought has done. So you have to face this. If you are inclined to be entertained for the rest of your life, then what happens to your brain? It will either wither, slowly decay because the computer is doing everything that thought can do, or you turn and look at the psychological structure of yourself. That psychological structure is consciousness.

                    <h1>Artificial intelligence is capable of destroying the world.</h1>
                <p>
                    I want to inquire into truth. I don’t know anything about it. I don’t want to depend on anyone to find out. So I have to discard all of the past. I want to find out what supreme intelligence is. So, can I discard everything that I know? The only instrument I have is thought. I can think clearly because I have been trained to think not sentimentally but objectively. Thinking which can produce so-called intelligence is then on the same level as thinking that has produced war. Therefore, it is not intelligence. So under no circumstances will thinking have a perception of that. I must be absolutely clear. If I am not clear unconsciously, deeply, then thought is going to interfere.

Before anything else, I want to clear the board. Is that possible? I see that what they are doing won’t get them there. They will create mechanical, artificial intelligence which is like human intelligence. That is capable of destroying the world. Thinking, and all the instruments thought has invented to investigate into that – meditation, various types of silence, various types of self-denial – are out. The technologies won’t accept that, but true inquiry is that. And they haven’t found it. They are anchored to thought, and they move through thought. They won’t accept that thought can under no circumstances come to it. Then what have I left to see that thought, under any circumstances, cannot produce intelligence?
