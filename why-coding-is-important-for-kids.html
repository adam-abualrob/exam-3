                <h1>Early Tech Education: Coding For Kids</h1>
                <p>
                    First of all, coding is, at its base, a creative process where you make something from scratch. Creating something from zero forces kids to use their imagination, ability, and skills all together at the same time, which leads to improvement in creativity. Therefore, through coding, curious and imaginative children become capable of thinking creatively.

Furthermore, coding is a fun and entertaining activity for kids. There are a lot of exciting methods for teaching coding, not only to kids but to all newcomers. For example, websites like code.org offer several puzzles, games, and exercises for kids. This is intended to attract their attention and is very successful in doing so, because coding is like magic and kids are thrilled to know how computers, games, and websites work.
                <h2>Advantages Of Coding For Kids</h2>
                <p>
                    Another advantage is an improvement in problem-solving abilities. Algorithms are the foundation for coding skills, it’s what coding teaches students as a first step. An algorithm is a collection of several steps or actions for completing certain processes and we use this technique for problem-solving. Mostly, programmers focus on the problems of the given task and try to build an algorithm that can solve these issues. Ultimately, coding helps to strengthen problem-solving skills, which kids can also use to overcome their future problems.

In addition, computers are built with zeros and ones, and mathematical operations are processed during the coding. Kids are learning how to use calculation methods, logical methods, and other mathematical operations for problem-solving. So, it helps kids to improve their computational thinking.

Finally, coding requires more practice rather than theory. Kids learn it by doing it. There are plenty of coding environments that everyone uses such as PyCharm, Visual Studio, etc. While learning to program, kids can practice their knowledge on applications like those mentioned above. Consequently, the study of coding offers practicality.

In conclusion, coding is crucial for everyone in today’s world as technology is evolving day by day. However, for those learning from their childhood, it will be much easier to adapt to the programming environment and become professionals in a short period of time. Therefore, parents are better off motivating their children to code as it can improve their skills in multiple fields and make them more prepared to face the problems of the present time.

                    <h2>Balancing Screen Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, spending too much time in front of screens, by using mobile devices, computers, and tablets, is one of the main problems for parents. Children using mobile devices can cause several physical and mental problems. How can we get rid of the dependence on social media, the internet, games, and TV? How much time can children spend utilizing digital devices and how to divide this time between learning and entertainment activities? Although the answers to these questions are different for every family, we would like to share some advice that can be helpful to all:

                    1. Keep A Balance
                    It would not be good to keep children absolutely away from digital devices or let them spend too much time on them. Create a balance between children’s weekly activities related to technology and those without technology. For most children, the main reason for excessive use of technological devices is not having opportunities for other activities, such as reading, drawing, and going to sports.
                    
                    2. Create A Place Away From Digital Devices And Spare Time To Use It
                    Create some places in your home where you do not use mobile devices and make time to spend there. For instance, while having a meal you should not use mobile devices and the internet. An hour before sleeping and in the bedroom you may restrict the use of mobile devices or computers. Especially do not let children use mobile devices and computers when they are alone. The computer should be in a room where you can see the screen easily.
                    
                    3. Be The Role Model
                    Your children pay more attention to what you do than to what you say and see you as a role model. Be careful about using technology while they are around you. Obey the rules regarding the usage of mobile devices at home and have a talk with your children about how to use technology effectively.
